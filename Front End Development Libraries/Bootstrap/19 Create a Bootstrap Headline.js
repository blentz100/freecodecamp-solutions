/*
Create a Bootstrap Headline
Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

To start with, create an h3 element, with the text jQuery Playground.

Color your h3 element with the text-primary Bootstrap class, and center it with the text-center Bootstrap class.

<h3 class ="text-center text-primary">jQuery Playground</h3>
