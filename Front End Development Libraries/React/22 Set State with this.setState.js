/*Set State with this.setState
The previous challenges covered component state and how to initialize state in
the constructor. There is also a way to change the component's state. React
provides a method for updating component state called setState. You call the
setState method within your component class like so: this.setState(), passing
in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the
values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a username
in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

this.setState({ username: 'Lewis' }); React expects you to never modify state
directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur. Also,
you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve
performance. What this means is that state updates through the setState method
can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the setState method
which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good
to keep it in mind! Please consult the React documentation for further details.

There is a button element in the code editor which has an onClick() handler.
This handler is triggered when the button receives a click event in the
browser, and runs the handleClick method defined on MyComponent. Within the
handleClick method, update the component state using this.setState(). Set the
name property in state to equal the string React Rocks!.

Click the button and watch the rendered state update. Don't worry if you don't
fully understand how the click handler code works at this point. It's covered
in upcoming challenges.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // Change code below this line
    console.log('inside handleClick()')
    this.setState({
      name: "React Rocks!"
    });
    
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
