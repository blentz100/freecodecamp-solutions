/* 
Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount React components have several
special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific
points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or
lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time.
This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive
props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main
lifecycle methods: componentWillMount() componentDidMount()
shouldComponentUpdate() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount() The next
several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle
methods.

Note: The componentWillMount Lifecycle method will be deprecated in a future
version of 16.X and removed in version 17. (Source)

The componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a
component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within
componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see
the output.
