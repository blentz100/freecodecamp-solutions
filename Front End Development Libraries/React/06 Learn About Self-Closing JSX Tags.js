/*Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags
So far, you’ve seen how JSX differs from HTML in a key way with the use of
className vs. class for defining HTML classes.

Another important way in which JSX differs from HTML is in the idea of the
self-closing tag.

In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: <div></div>; the
closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are
closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing
tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before
another tag can start.

For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should
never be written as <br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a
self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for
example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be
transpiled. A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or
<div></div>. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way
to include anything in the <div />. You will see in later challenges that this
syntax is useful when rendering React components.

Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully
transpiles. Make sure you don't change any of the content - you only need to
close tags where they are needed.

    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
