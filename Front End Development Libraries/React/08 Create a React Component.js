/*
Create a React Component The other way to define a React component is with the
ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

class Kitten extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); }

  render() { return ( <h1>Hi</h1>); } } This creates an ES6 class Kitten which
extends the React.Component class. So the Kitten class now has access to many
useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if
you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater
detail in later challenges. Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor
defined within it that calls super(). It uses super() to call the constructor
of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special
method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the
class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with
super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized
properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included. Soon
you will see other uses for the constructor as well as props.

MyComponent is defined in the code editor using class syntax. Finish writing
the render method so it returns a div element that contains an h1 with the text
Hello React!.
*/ 

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    return(<div><h1>Hello React!</h1></div>)
    // Change code above this line
  }
};
