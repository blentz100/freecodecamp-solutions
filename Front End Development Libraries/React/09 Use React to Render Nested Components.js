/* Use React to Render Nested Components The last challenge showed a simple way
to compose two components, but there are many different ways you can compose
components with React.

Component composition is one of React's powerful features. When you work with
React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in terms of
components like the App example in the last challenge. You break down your UI
into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. This
helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for
handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the development and
maintenance of complex projects.

There are two functional components defined in the code editor, called
TypesOfFruit and Fruits. Take the TypesOfFruit component and compose it, or
nest it, within the Fruits component. Then take the Fruits component and nest
it within the TypesOfFood component. The result should be a child component,
nested within a parent component, which is nested within a parent component of
its own! */ 

const TypesOfFruit = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Fruits:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Blueberries</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

const Fruits = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      { /* Change code below this line */ }
      <TypesOfFruit/>
      { /* Change code above this line */ }
    </div>
  );
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <Fruits />
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
