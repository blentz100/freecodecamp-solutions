/*Render State in the User Interface Another Way
There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method,
before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example,
you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform
computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to
variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

In the MyComponent render method, define a const called name and set it equal
to the name value in the component's state. Because you can write JavaScript
directly in this part of the code, you don't have to enclose this reference in
curly braces.

Next, in the return statement, render this value in an h1 tag using the
variable name. Remember, you need to use the JSX syntax (curly braces for
JavaScript) in the return statement.

        <h1>{name}</h1>
