/*
Render a Class Component to the DOM You may remember using the ReactDOM API in
an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the DOM. The process for
rendering React components will look very similar. The past few challenges
focused on components and composition, so the rendering was done for you behind
the scenes. However, none of the React code you write will render to the DOM
without making a call to the ReactDOM API.

Here's a refresher on the syntax: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender,
targetNode). The first argument is the React component that you want to render.
The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component
within.

React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than
JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you
want to render. However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax
as if you were rendering a nested component, for example
ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode). You use this syntax for
both ES6 class components and functional components.

Both the Fruits and Vegetables components are defined for you behind the
scenes. Render both components as children of the TypesOfFood component, then
render TypesOfFood to the DOM. There is a div with id='challenge-node'
available for you to use.

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    console.log('hi')

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <Fruits />
        <Vegetables />
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
};
// Change code below this line
ReactDOM.render(<TypesOfFood/>, document.getElementById("challenge-node"));
