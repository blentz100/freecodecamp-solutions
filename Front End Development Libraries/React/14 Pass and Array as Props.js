/* 
Pass an Array as Props The last challenge demonstrated how to pass information
from a parent component to a child component as props or properties. This
challenge looks at how arrays can be passed as props. To pass an array to a JSX
element, it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

<ParentComponent> <ChildComponent colors={["green", "blue", "red"]} />
</ParentComponent> The child component then has access to the array property
colors. Array methods such as join() can be used when accessing the property.
const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p> This will
join all colors array items into a comma separated string and produce:
<p>green, blue, red</p> Later, we will learn about other common methods to
render arrays of data in React.

There are List and ToDo components in the code editor. When rendering each List
from the ToDo component, pass in a tasks property assigned to an array of to-do
tasks, for example ["walk dog", "workout"]. Then access this tasks array in the
List component, showing its value within the p element. Use join(", ") to
display the props.tasksarray in the p element as a comma separated list.
Today's list should have at least 2 tasks and tomorrow's should have at least 3
tasks.
*/ 

const List = (props) => {
  { /* Change code below this line */ }
  return <p>{props.tasks.join(", ")}</p>
  { /* Change code above this line */ }
};

class ToDo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>To Do Lists</h1>
        <h2>Today</h2>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <List tasks={["walk dog", "workout"]}/>
        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
        <List tasks={["code", "meditate", "walk"]}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
