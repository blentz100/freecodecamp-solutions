/*
Create a Controlled Input Your application may have more complex interactions
between state and the rendered UI. For example, form control elements for text
input, such as input and textarea, maintain their own state in the DOM as the
user types. With React, you can move this mutable state into a React
component's state. The user's input becomes part of the application state, so
React controls the value of that input field. Typically, if you have React
components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled
input form.

The code editor has the skeleton of a component called ControlledInput to
create a controlled input element. The component's state is already initialized
with an input property that holds an empty string. This value represents the
text a user types into the input field.

First, create a method called handleChange() that has a parameter called event.
When the method is called, it receives an event object that contains a string
of text from the input element. You can access this string with
event.target.value inside the method. Update the input property of the
component's state with this new string.

In the render method, create the input element above the h4 tag. Add a value
attribute which is equal to the input property of the component's state. Then
add an onChange() event handler set to the handleChange() method.

When you type in the input box, that text is processed by the handleChange()
method, set as the input property in the local state, and rendered as the value
in the input box on the page. The component state is the single source of truth
regarding the input data.

Last but not least, don't forget to add the necessary bindings in the
constructor.
