/*Bind 'this' to a Class Method
In addition to setting and updating state, you can also define methods for your
component class. A class method typically needs to use the this keyword so it
can access properties on the class (such as state and props) inside the scope
of the method. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access this.

One common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so this becomes
bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. You may have
noticed the last challenge used this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
for its handleClick method in the constructor. Then, when you call a function
like this.setState() within your class method, this refers to the class and
will not be undefined.

Note: The this keyword is one of the most confusing aspects of JavaScript but
it plays an important role in React. Although its behavior here is totally
normal, these lessons aren't the place for an in-depth review of this so please
refer to other lessons if the above is confusing!

The code editor has a component with a state that keeps track of the text. It
also has a method which allows you to set the text to You clicked!. However,
the method doesn't work because it's using the this keyword that is undefined.
Fix it by explicitly binding this to the handleClick() method in the
component's constructor.

Next, add a click handler to the button element in the render method. It should
trigger the handleClick() method when the button receives a click event.
Remember that the method you pass to the onClick handler needs curly braces
because it should be interpreted directly as JavaScript.

Once you complete the above steps you should be able to click the button and
see You clicked!.

      text: "You clicked!"
    });

    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
        <h1>{this.state.text}</h1>
      </div>
