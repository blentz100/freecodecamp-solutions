/*
Nest CSS with Sass Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of
organizing a style sheet.

Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

nav { background-color: red; }

nav ul { list-style: none; }

nav ul li { display: inline-block; } For a large project, the CSS file will
have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize your code by
placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

nav { background-color: red;

  ul { list-style: none;

    li { display: inline-block; } } }

Use the nesting technique shown above to re-organize the CSS rules for both
children of .blog-post element. For testing purposes, the h1 should come before
the p element.
*/

<style type='text/scss'>
  .blog-post {
    h1 {
      text-align: center;
      color: blue;
    }
    p {
      font-size: 20px;
    }

  }
  
</style>

<div class="blog-post">
  <h1>Blog Title</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</div>
