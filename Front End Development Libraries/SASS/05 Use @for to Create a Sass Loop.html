Use @for to Create a Sass Loop The @for directive adds styles in a loop, very
similar to a for loop in JavaScript.

@for is used in two ways: "start through end" or "start to end". The main
difference is that the "start to end" excludes the end number as part of the
count, and "start through end" includes the end number as part of the count.

Here's a start through end example:

@for $i from 1 through 12 { .col-#{$i} { width: 100%/12 * $i; } } The #{$i}
part is the syntax to combine a variable (i) with text to make a string. When
the Sass file is converted to CSS, it looks like this:

.col-1 { width: 8.33333%; }

.col-2 { width: 16.66667%; }

...

.col-12 { width: 100%; } This is a powerful way to create a grid layout. Now
you have twelve options for column widths available as CSS classes.

Write a @for directive that takes a variable $j that goes from 1 to 6.

It should create 5 classes called .text-1 to .text-5 where each has a font-size
set to 15px multiplied by the index.

<style type='text/scss'>
@for $j from 1 to 6{
  .text-#{$j}{
    font-size: 15px * $j;
  }
}
</style>

<p class="text-1">Hello</p>
<p class="text-2">Hello</p>
<p class="text-3">Hello</p>
<p class="text-4">Hello</p>
<p class="text-5">Hello</p>
