/* Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks with Partials Partials in Sass are
separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in
other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to
keep it organized.

Names for partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it
is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass
files end with the .scss file extension. To bring the code in the partial into
another Sass file, use the @import directive.

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss",
and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the
main file:

@import 'mixins' Note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in
the import statement - Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is
imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other code are available to
use.

Write an @import statement to import a partial named _variables.scss into the
main.scss file. */

<!-- The main.scss file -->
@import 'variables'
