/*Create Reusable CSS with Mixins
In Sass, a mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout
the style sheet.

Newer CSS features take time before they are fully adopted and ready to use in
all browsers. As features are added to browsers, CSS rules using them may need
vendor prefixes. Consider box-shadow:

div { -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff; -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
-ms-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff; box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff; } It's a lot of
typing to re-write this rule for all the elements that have a box-shadow, or to
change each value to test different effects. Mixins are like functions for CSS.
Here is how to write one:

@mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $c){ -webkit-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
-moz-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c; -ms-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c; box-shadow: $x
$y $blur $c; } The definition starts with @mixin followed by a custom name. The
parameters (the $x, $y, $blur, and $c in the example above) are optional. Now
any time a box-shadow rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin
replaces having to type all the vendor prefixes. A mixin is called with the
@include directive:

div { @include box-shadow(0px, 0px, 4px, #fff); } Write a mixin for
border-radius and give it a $radius parameter. It should use all the vendor
prefixes from the example. Then use the border-radius mixin to give the
#awesome element a border radius of 15px.

<style type='text/scss'>

  @mixin border-radius($radius){
    -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
    -moz-border-radius: $radius;
    -ms-border-radius: $radius;
    border-radius: $radius;
    
  }
  
  #awesome {
    
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
    background-color: green;
    @include border-radius(15px);

  }
</style>

<div id="awesome"></div>
