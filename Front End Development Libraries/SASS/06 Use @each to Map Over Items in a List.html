/* Use @each to Map Over Items in a List The last challenge showed how the @for
directive uses a starting and ending value to loop a certain number of times.
Sass also offers the @each directive which loops over each item in a list or
map. On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from
the list or map.

@each $color in blue, red, green { .#{$color}-text {color: $color;} } A map has
slightly different syntax. Here's an example:

$colors: (color1: blue, color2: red, color3: green);

@each $key, $color in $colors { .#{$color}-text {color: $color;} } Note that
the $key variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. Otherwise, the
compiled CSS would have color1, color2... in it. Both of the above code
examples are converted into the following CSS:

.blue-text { color: blue; }

.red-text { color: red; }

.green-text { color: green; } Write an @each directive that goes through a
list: blue, black, red and assigns each variable to a .color-bg class, where
the color part changes for each item. Each class should set the
background-color the respective color.
