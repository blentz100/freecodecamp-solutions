/*
 * Understand the Prototype Chain
All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an
object’s prototype itself is an object.

function Bird(name) { this.name = name; }

typeof Bird.prototype; Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have
its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is
Object.prototype:

Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype); How is this useful? You may
recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous challenge:

let duck = new Bird("Donald"); duck.hasOwnProperty("name"); The hasOwnProperty
method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Bird.prototype,
which can then be accessed by duck. This is an example of the prototype chain.
In this prototype chain, Bird is the supertype for duck, while duck is the
subtype. Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck. Object is a supertype for
all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty
method.

Modify the code to show the correct prototype chain.

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);  // yields true

// Fix the code below so that it evaluates to true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype);

// Not really sure why the above line solves the problem...
