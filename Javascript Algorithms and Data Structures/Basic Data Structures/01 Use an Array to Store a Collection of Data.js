/*Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data
The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data
structure. This is known as a one-dimensional array, meaning it only has one
level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Notice it
contains booleans, strings, and numbers, among other valid JavaScript data
types:

let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
console.log(simpleArray.length); The console.log call displays 7.

All arrays have a length property, which as shown above, can be very easily
accessed with the syntax Array.length. A more complex implementation of an array
can be seen below. This is known as a multi-dimensional array, or an array that
contains other arrays. Notice that this array also contains JavaScript objects,
which we will examine very closely in our next section, but for now, all you
need to know is that arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.

let complexArray = [ [ { one: 1, two: 2 }, { three: 3, four: 4 } ], [ { a: "a",
b: "b" }, { c: "c", d: "d" } ] ];

We have defined a variable called yourArray. Complete the statement by assigning
an array of at least 5 elements in length to the yourArray variable. Your array
should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.
*/

let yourArray = [true,false,"myfirstarray", 56234234,"this array contains 5 elements"]; // Change this line

console.log("yourArray.length is: " + yourArray.length)
