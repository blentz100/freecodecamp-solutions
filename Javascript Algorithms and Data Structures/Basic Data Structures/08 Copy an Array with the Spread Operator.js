/*Copy an Array with the Spread Operator
While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy,
among several other useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily
copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable
syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:

let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null]; let thatArray =
[...thisArray]; thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray
remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.

We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a
number) as arguments. The function is supposed to return a new array made up of
num copies of arr. We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work
quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works
correctly (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy
here!).

*/

function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line
    newArr.push([...arr])
    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));
