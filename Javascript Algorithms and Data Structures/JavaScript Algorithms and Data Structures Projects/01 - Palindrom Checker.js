/*
 * Palindrome Checker
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and
backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces
and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in
order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR
among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and
2_A3*3#A2.

function palindrome(str) {
  return true;
  //solved but lost the solution, need to rewrite, here is the outline

  //make everything lowerCase

  //strip out all non alpha numeric characters

  //slice it in half depending on the length, maybe just remove the middle character if its odd length

  //convert each slice to an array

  //reverse the second array

  //compare both arrays with  
  
  //JSON.stringify(arr1)==JSON.stringify(arr2)
