/* Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console
You may have noticed that some freeCodeCamp challenges include their own
console. This console behaves a little differently than the browser console.

There are many methods to use with console to output messages. log, warn, and
clear to name a few. The freeCodeCamp console will only output log messages,
while the browser console will output all messages. When you make changes to
your code, it will automatically run and show the logs. The freeCodeCamp console
is then cleared each time your code runs.

First, open your browser console so you can see the logs. To do that, you can
right-click the freeCodeCamp navigation bar at the top and click inspect on most
browsers. Then find the console tab in the window that opens.

After that, use console.log to log the output variable. View the two consoles to
see the log. Finally, use console.clear after your log to clear the browser
console. View the difference in the two consoles. */

let output = "Get this to show once in the freeCodeCamp console and not at all in the browser console";

console.log(output);
console.clear();
