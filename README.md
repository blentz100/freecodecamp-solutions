I'm using the freecodecamp curriculum as a tool to reinforce and practice basic
web development, Javascript and React skills.

I completed the Responsive Web Design Certificate and now I'm working through
the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Cert and the Front End Development
Libraries Cert.

I'm adding the solutions here as a way to continue to practice working with git,
github and to document my progress.

#### Notes

Workflow for creating all the filenames from a given section without typing it
out manually.

- Copy and paste the challenge names from the browser into a vim buffer
- Use find and replace to get rid of extra stuff: https://linuxize.com/post/vim-find-replace/
- Delete all blank lines with: :g\^$\d https://linuxize.com/post/vim-delete-line/#:~:text=%3Ag%2F%5E%24%2Fd%20%2D,characters%20(%20%5Cs*%20).
- Use a macro to append .js to each line : https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macros
- Manually put numbers on the front of each line - todo - find an automated
solution
- Create a list of filenames from a text file: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/456632/create-files-from-a-list-of-text-files
- Use the GNU version of xargs : https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/findutils
