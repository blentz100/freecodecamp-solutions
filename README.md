I'm using the freecodecamp curriculum as a tool to reinforce and practice basic
web development, Javascript and React skills.

I completed the Responsive Web Design Certificate and now I'm working through
the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Cert and the Front End Development
Libraries Cert.

I'm adding the solutions here as a way to continue to practice working with git,
github and to document my progress.
